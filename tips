Stochastic Settings

Stochastics is one indicator.  Fast, slow and full are merely definitions of that same indicator.  The settings we choose is what defines whether that stochastics is fast, slow or full.

FAST: %K is set to 1.  We choose the period and the %D.
SLOW: %K is set to 3.  We choose the period and the %D.
FULL: We choose the period, the %K and the %D.
Since the setting we use is 12,3,3 (Period= 12, %K= 3, %D= 3), we would call this a SLOW stochastics.
